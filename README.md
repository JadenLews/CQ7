Running time: My solution has a for loops that runs n times, there a for loop within it that runs from where ever it is to 0, theres a constant amount of work to be done in that, which makes the running time O(n^2)
The space complexity for this is the "total" integer, "j" "i", "jay", and "temp", i never make a copy of the input array, which means the space is constant O(1)
Ice Cream: The way my algorithm works is that DP is the size of the array x the target sum x the amount of ice creams wanted. The base cases is the when target == 0 and when the amount of ice creams wanted also is 0. It figures out how many possible ways there are to sum up to the total by doing a take or dont take check, if take and dont take both work, then i take the max of the two and add 1. If only one works we take that integer and place it in the location. I use -1 to imply that this cannot be exactly summed down to 0. Because we need a perfect sum.
If we can take a ice cream and not take an ice cream to be able to get to the target amount, then we have one more possible way to get to the total than the max amount of ways to get to the total between the take and dont take path. It just checks to see if it is possible by seeing its not -1. If only one of the paths works, then we can only take the value at that amount and we dont add 1 because we arent given a choice.
